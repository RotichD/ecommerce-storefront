# E-Commerce Store Front

## Description

I built this Front End Online Store to practice responsive design, fetching and displaying data, and learning new web development tools. This is the Front End portion of a 2 part Full Stack Project. You can find the repository for the custom made CMS backend [here](https://github.com/RotichD/ecommerce-admin)

## Future Plans

I'd like to enhance the database models to handle more than one size and color per product. On the Front End of the store it would be nice to have the ability to choose between sizes and colors. I'd also like to implement a functioning rating system that users contribute to. Manage state with Redux or Recoil. Add loading skeletons.
